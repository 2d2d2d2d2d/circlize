- testing code
- put margin and padding into cell.data
- put all global variable into an env variable
- comments and documents
- calculate the length of the parabola
- use `strwidth` to draw text along to the circle
- `cell.padding` in `circos.par` should not affect the value of `xlim`, add a new element
- need to think about whether enforce all degree in [0, 360) ? (because now 0 and 360 all exist, which makes the problem)
- use `degree.add` and `degree.minus` to replace all degree math, so it would be simpler to support clock wise mode

# long term
the order of sector to support clockwise
the direction of y-axis can be set (currently pointing to the outside)
- `circos.lines` add an `area` argument
