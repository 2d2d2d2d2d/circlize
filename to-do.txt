- testing code
- put margin and padding into cell.data
- put all global variable into an env variable
- comments and documents
- calculate the length of the parabola
- use `strwidth` to draw text along to the circle
- `cell.padding` in `circos.par` should not affect the value of `xlim`, add a new element
- the orders of two parabolas in the belt link need to be looked at (add code to identify the sequence of four end points)
- end of each link belt should be an arc (need a `arc.point` function)

# long term
the order of sector to support clockwise
the direction of y-axis can be set (currently pointing to the outside)
